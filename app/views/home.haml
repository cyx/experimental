    Hello, world!
    =============

    This is a [Monk](http://monkrb.com) skeleton that uses [Redis](http://redis.io) as the database and [HAML](http://haml-lang.com/) for the views. In addition, we use [Less.js](http://github.com/cloudhead/less.js) for CSS. This skeleton lives at [http://github.com/monk/skeleton](http://github.com/monk/skeleton).

    The page you are looking at was generated by `app/routes/site.rb`, and the template is located at `app/views/home.haml`.

    Settings
    --------

    Check the configuration file at `config/settings.rb`. The keys under each environment can be accessed with the Sinatra helper `settings` function, and you will also find an example in the default route.

    Redis is connected to `#{@redis[:host]}:#{@redis[:port]}`. If you want to change it, you can change the REDIS_URL environment variable, e.g.

    `export REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:22222/0`


    Testing
    -------

    There's a user story written for you at `test/stories/site_test.rb`. Start adding whatever you want to test and then run `rake test`.

    Dependencies
    ------------

    We use RVM gemsets. All dependencies are listed in `default.gems`. You can import it by doing the following:

    `rvm --create use 1.9.2@myapp`

    `rvm gemset import`

    where myapp is the name of your project. If you want to automatically change to the gemset everytime you `cd` into your project, it's as simple as:

    `echo "rvm --create use 1.9.2@myapp" > .rvmrc`
